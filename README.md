### Reflections and Comments

1. How did this go, overall?

  - I thought I could make something complex in HTML, but I just didn't have enough time so I used the in demo for today as the guideline and had to remake my HTML from scratch with two hours before the due date.

2. What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?

- I cannot figure out if grid is helpful or not. I can't figure out CSS and how to move certain things around with grid laid out from the grid website.

3. How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
 
- It took me 11 hours because I had to restart to hit at least some of the instructions for lab 11. I thought it would take me long but didn't think it would take this long.

### Reflections and Comments

1. How did this go, overall?

  - This went a lot better in terms of JS, I was able to figure out how to render results after voting and make sure no two images appeared in two rounds. CSS was a pain when I was trying to work with grid. I gave up on that and went back to flexbox.

2. What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?

- It is extremely helpful to use a third party JS source. If only there was something like that for CSS to make it easier.

3. How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
 
- This took me 5 hours which was 6 less then yesterday so that is a huge win for me. I thought it was going to take longer to be honest but I'm glad it didn't.
